  - The ticker symbol : Loop through ticker for each quarter 
  
  - Quarterly change: Loop through using close value from last date - open value from first date for each quarter 
    - if the value > 0 color in green, value < 0 color in red, value = 0 then  no color
    
  - Percentage change: Loop through (last date - first date)/ first date *100 for each quarter 
    - if the value > 0 color in green, value < 0 color in red, value = 0 then  no color
    
  - The total stock volume of the stock: Loop through vol in column L

  - Add Greatest Increase, Greatest Decrease and Greatest Total Value with related Ticker
